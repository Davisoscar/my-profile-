    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>I love music; it's my way of tapping into and expressing deep emotions. Playing the guitar and working on production, especially with that vibrant '80s flair, has become a passion of mine. It's a journey that continues to evolve, and I'm excited to see where it takes me.</p>

    <p>I've always had a passion for football, watching games with my dad and rooting for Luton Town. It's more than just a game to us; it's our tradition.</p>
